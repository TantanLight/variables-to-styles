# Variables to Styles
The plugin will add any variables with matching names to your file's local styles. Things to be aware of:
- The plugin will scan for local and remote variable collections.
- Remote variable collections have to be added to the file before using the plugin - I'd recommend reloading the file after connecting them.
- Figma Plugin API isn't very stable - remote variables sometimes work and sometimes don't - try to close the plugin and open it again.
- The structure of the variables and styles has to be the same.

An example for matching style and variable:
- a style name "core/colours/black" will show as black inside a *folder* called colours inside a *folder* named core.
- A variant name "core/colours/black" will show as back inside a *group* called colours inside a *group* named core.

## Development guide

*This plugin is built with [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/).*

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) – v20
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

### Build the plugin

To build the plugin:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) file and a `build/` directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the plugin.

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```
$ npm run watch
```

### Install the plugin

1. In the Figma desktop app, open a Figma document.
2. Search for and run `Import plugin from manifest…` via the Quick Actions search bar.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file that was generated by the `build` script.

### Debugging

Use `console.log` statements to inspect values in your code.

To open the developer console, search for and run `Show/Hide Console` via the Quick Actions search bar.
